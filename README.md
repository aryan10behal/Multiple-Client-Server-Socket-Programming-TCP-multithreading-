# Socket-Programming

--> I have tried to implement simple server-client socket communication using TCP sockets using multi-threading to handle multiple clients. The server connects to the client on clients request.
--> The client ask the server its top N time-consuming processes. 
--> Server sends information to the client after making a local file at its end.
--> The client receives information and makes a file at its local storage.

How to run?

1. Compile both codes using gcc filename.c -pthread -o file_executable_name
2. Run server program in one terminal.
3. Run client programs from other terminals.
